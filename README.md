Stock Price Predictor via LSTM is designed to be an intuitive web app that allows for a flexible analysis of stocks.

# Features
With this model, you can see how over a chosen timeframe for a moving average, the stock price for a particular company has changed over the past 10 years. 
Additionally, the model performs a Long Short Term Memory analysis on the past 10 years to analyze where the stock price will be going. Then, this project 
creates a web app that shows the predicted model and the trends in stock prices, helping people make more informed decisions on stock investments.
